How the bot works?
This bot is designed to educate the users on important cybersecurity related topics such as passowrds, phishing, and safe browsing.
The bot uses a conversational approach to answer user questions and provide valuable advice. So as the bot launches:

1) Immediatetly when you run the code the audio. wav starts to play as it welcomes you as the user.
2) The ACSII art logo appears then after the bot welcomes you with a test message. Then the bot records your name as it informs you its here to help you with your questions related to cybersecurity and as well as a exit option is given to you if you want 
exit anytime. If the user types "exit", the conversation ends by calling the Exitconversation() method otherwise the ProcessUserInput method is called to analyze the user's input and provide a response.
3) The bot asks for your input, it checks for input validation and checks is your input vaild as it related to the cybersecurity topics.
4) If so it answers your validated input or else it lets you know to rephrase your question. Here is a guide for the colored text:
-cyan, is used for welcoming messages and draw attention to important information
-green, provides advice on password safety, creating a positive association
-magenta, phishing advice which highlights security-related topics
-red, error messages
These colors makes text more appealing and easier to follow.
